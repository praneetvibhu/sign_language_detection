# American Sign Language Detection

This repo implements a nueral network to perform a classification task on the [American Sign Language Finger Spelling Dataset](https://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/np331/index.php?section=FingerSpellingDataset). 

We implement 2 different models, both of them based on Convolutional Neural Networks. One of them works with the raw images, and the other one works with segmented images.
